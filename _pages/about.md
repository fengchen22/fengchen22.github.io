Welcome to my webpage! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics with research interests in public economics and labor economics. I have a broad interest in applied microeconomics and am particularly interested in topics related to family, gender, and education.  My current research agenda focuses on the heterogeneous effects of the #Metoo movement in sexism on sexual crime reporting, the system effect of Charter school reform on student outcomes, and the causal effects of Paid Family Leave on infant mortality.
   
I am on the 2021-2022 job market, and I will be available for interviews at the 2022 ASSA meetings. Please find more information in my [CV](http://fengchen22.github.io/files/feng_cv.pdf) and contact me at fchen9@tulane.edu.
