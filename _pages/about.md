<font size=5> Welcome to my website! </font>

<font size=5>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Tulane University. I have a broad interest in applied microeconomics and am particularly interested in topics related to family, education, and gender.  My current research agenda focuses on the causal effect of paid family leave on infant mortality, the system effect of Charter school reform on student outcomes, and the role of sexism in sexual crime reporting in the #MeToo era. </font>

<font size=5>I am on the 2021-2022 job market, and I will be available for interviews at the 2022 ASSA meetings. </font>
