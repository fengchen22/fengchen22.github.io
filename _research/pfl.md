title: "Does Paid Family Leave Save Infant Lives? Evidence from California"
collection: research

One goal of the paid family leave program in the U.S. is to help working parents balance their careers and family responsibilities and hence improve the well-being of their infants. A large body of literature evaluates the effects of California’s Paid Family Leave program (CA-PFL) on early childhood outcomes, but most studies have been based on the analyses of surviving infants. If the CA-PFL reduces infant deaths, then such analyses would understate the program’s true effects. Using the linked birth and infant death data in the U.S. with a difference-in-differences framework, I find that the implementation of the CA-PFL reduced the post-neonatal mortality rate by 0.135 (per 1,000 live births), or it saved approximately 339 infant lives in California from 2004 to 2008. The effects were driven by death from internal causes and there were larger effects for boys than girls. These results are stable across a variety of robustness checks and no evidence suggests that these estimates result from the endogeneity of policy, simultaneously shocks, and changes in fertility.
